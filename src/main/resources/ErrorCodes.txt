Here is a list of error codes that could be thrown by exceptions and other errors in the program:






246: Group.addSite
    You tried to add a site that is already in the group (the names were the same).
247: GroupManager.newGroup
    The ArrayList that stores the list of groups already contains the group that is trying to be added, or at least a group with that name. Duplicates may not be added.
248: GroupManager.newGroup
    The CSVM.AddToEndOfCSV function threw an error. this could be because a file was messed with, deleted, or the group trying to be added was invalid in some other way.
