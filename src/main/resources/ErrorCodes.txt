Here is a list of error codes that could be thrown by exceptions and other errors in the program:



247: GroupManager.newGroup
    The ArrayList that stores the list of groups already contains the group that is trying to be added, or at least a group with that name. Duplicates may not be added.
248: GroupManager.newGroup
    The CSVM.AddToEndOfCSV function threw an error. this could be because a file was messed with, deleted, or the group trying to be added was invalid in some other way.
